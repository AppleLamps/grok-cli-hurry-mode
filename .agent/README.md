## 🎯 Usage Guidelines

### For AI Agents
1. **Always read README.md first** - Get project overview (this file)
2. **Check system/critical-state.md** - Understand current architecture
3. **Review relevant tasks/** - Check for related work or conflicts
4. **Follow sop/** patterns - Use established conventions
5. **Check guardrails/** - Avoid known failure patterns

### For Updates
- Run `/update-agent-docs` after significant changes
- Add new PRDs to tasks/ before implementation
- Update system docs when architecture changes
- Document new patterns in sop/
