# Testing Advanced Tools in Grok CLI

## ‚úÖ P1 Advanced Tools Implementation Complete!

The following advanced tools have been successfully implemented and integrated into Grok CLI:

## üß™ How to Test Locally

### 1. Set up Environment
```bash
cd /Users/based/Documents/Github/hurry/grok-cli-hurry-mode

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set your Grok API key
export GROK_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Run in development mode
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Advanced Tools

Once running, you can test the new advanced tools with natural language commands:

#### **Multi-File Operations**
```
"Create multiple test files atomically - one with JavaScript code, one with Python code, and one with documentation"

"Begin a transaction to rename multiple files and move them to a new directory structure"

"Preview the multi-file changes before committing them"
```

#### **Advanced Search & Replace**
```
"Search for all function definitions using regex pattern across JavaScript files"

"Find and replace 'calculateSum' with 'addNumbers' in all files with preview"

"Search for TODO comments with 3 lines of context in TypeScript files"
```

#### **File Tree Operations**
```
"Generate a visual tree of the src/tools directory with file sizes"

"Organize all test files by file type into separate directories"

"Clean up any empty directories in the project"

"Copy the directory structure from src/tools to backup/tools without files"
```

#### **Code Analysis & Refactoring**
```
"Analyze the code structure of test-example.js and show all functions and classes"

"Refactor test-example.js to rename the Calculator class to MathCalculator"

"Extract the history tracking logic into a separate function"

"Add missing imports to test-example.js"

"Format the code in test-example.py with proper indentation"
```

#### **Operation History**
```
"Show my operation history from the last 10 actions"

"Undo the last file operation"

"Redo the operation I just undid"

"Go back to a specific point in history"

"Clear my operation history"
```

## üîß Technical Testing

### Test the Tools Directly
```bash
# Run the standalone test we created earlier
bun run test-advanced-tools.ts
```

### Check Integration
The advanced tools are now available through these tool calls in the agent:
- `multi_file_edit` - Multi-file operations with transactions
- `advanced_search` - Enhanced search with regex and bulk replace  
- `file_tree_ops` - Directory tree operations and file management
- `code_analysis` - Code structure analysis and refactoring
- `operation_history` - Undo/redo and history management

## üìÅ Test Files Created

- `test-example.js` - JavaScript file with functions and classes for testing code analysis
- `test-example.py` - Python file with type hints for testing language detection

## üéØ What's New

The advanced tools provide Claude Code-level capabilities:

1. **Transaction-based multi-file editing** with atomic operations
2. **Regex-powered search and replace** with preview and bulk operations  
3. **Visual file tree generation** with filtering and bulk operations
4. **Language-aware code analysis** supporting JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java
5. **Smart refactoring operations** like rename, extract function, import management
6. **Comprehensive undo/redo system** with persistent history and snapshots

## üöÄ Next Steps

With P1 complete, the next phase (P2) would focus on:
- AST parsing for deeper code understanding
- Symbol search across codebases
- Advanced Git integration with semantic analysis
- Testing framework integration
- Performance optimizations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- The new tools are fully integrated but the existing TypeScript errors in the UI components don't affect the advanced tools functionality
- All advanced tools include confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- Operation history is persisted to `~/.grok/operation-history.json`
- Transaction logs help with debugging multi-file operations
