---

## Testing Strategy

---

## Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks
- [x] Infinite loops → Mitigated by max attempts
- [x] Performance impact → Negligible (async)
- [x] User confusion → Mitigated by clear messaging
- [x] Breaking changes → None (additive only)
- [x] Incomplete plans → Mitigated by validation

### Mitigation Strategies
- [x] Limit correction attempts to 3
- [x] Use async plan generation
- [x] Clear UI messaging
- [x] Comprehensive testing
- [x] Plan validation before execution

---

## Success Criteria Verification

- [x] Agent detects complex requests automatically
- [x] User can approve/reject plans
- [x] Plans execute sequentially
- [x] Failed tools trigger fallback strategies
- [x] LLM re-engages with fallback requests
- [x] Correction attempts are tracked
- [x] Existing functionality preserved
- [x] Performance impact < 5%

## Recommendations

### Before Implementation
1. **Review** this plan with the team
2. **Approve** the approach and timeline
3. **Assign** developer(s) to each phase
4. **Set up** testing infrastructure

### During Implementation
1. **Test** each phase before moving to next
2. **Document** any deviations from plan
