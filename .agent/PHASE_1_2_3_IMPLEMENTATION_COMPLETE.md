---

## üìù Changes Made

### 1. New Properties Added to GrokAgent Class

**File**: `src/agent/grok-agent.ts` (lines 95-107)

```typescript
// Correction attempt tracking for LLM re-engagement
private correctionAttempts: Map<string, Array<{
  tool: string;
  error: string;
  timestamp: number;
  fallbackStrategy: string;
}>> = new Map();
private readonly maxCorrectionAttempts: number = 3;
```

### 2. New Methods Added

#### `shouldCreatePlan(message: string): boolean`
**Location**: Lines 1520-1555  
**Purpose**: Detect if a user request warrants automatic task planning

**Features**:
- Complexity keyword detection (refactor, move, extract, implement, etc.)
- Multiple file mention detection
- Architecture/design pattern detection
- Scope indicator detection
- Complexity scoring system (threshold: 3)

#### `generateAndConfirmPlan(userRequest: string)`
**Location**: Lines 1557-1590  
**Purpose**: Generate plan and request user confirmation

**Features**:
- Creates plan using TaskOrchestrator
- Formats plan preview with validation
- Requests user confirmation via ConfirmationTool
- Returns approval status and plan

#### `executePlanSteps(plan: TaskPlan)`
**Location**: Lines 1592-1643  
**Purpose**: Execute plan steps sequentially with dependency handling

**Features**:
- Dependency checking before execution
- Step status tracking (running, completed, failed, skipped)
- Tool call creation from plan steps
- Auto-rollback on failure support
- Result collection and reporting

#### `handleSelfCorrectAttempt(toolResult, toolCall, userRequest)`
**Location**: Lines 1645-1680  
**Purpose**: Handle self-correction attempts by re-engaging the LLM

**Features**:
- Tracks correction attempts per request (max 3)
- Extracts fallback request from error message
- Returns retry decision and fallback request
- Prevents infinite correction loops

#### `hashRequest(request: string): string`
**Location**: Lines 1682-1690  
**Purpose**: Hash a request for tracking correction attempts

## üîß Integration Points

### 1. Plan Detection Integration
**Location**: Lines 555-615 in `processUserMessageStream`

**Flow**:
1. Check if request should trigger planning
2. Generate and confirm plan with user
3. Execute plan steps if approved
4. Report results and exit
5. Fall back to standard loop if rejected

### 2. Self-Correction Integration
**Location**: Lines 752-801 in tool execution batch

**Flow**:
1. Execute tool and check for SELF_CORRECT_ATTEMPT signal
2. Handle correction attempt tracking
3. Add fallback request to conversation
4. Mark for retry or exhaustion
5. Yield correction notifications after batch

### 3. Refactoring Assistant Modification
**Location**: Lines 1069-1089 in `executeTool`

**Change**: Returns SELF_CORRECT_ATTEMPT signal instead of calling attemptFallback

**Signal Format**:
```typescript
{
  success: false,
  error: "SELF_CORRECT_ATTEMPT: [error message and fallback suggestion]",
  metadata: {
    originalTool: 'refactoring_assistant',
    originalError: error.message,
    suggestedApproach: 'multi_file_edit',
    fallbackTools: ['multi_file_edit', 'code_analysis', 'str_replace_editor']
  }
}
```

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Plan Detection
**Input**: "Refactor the authentication system across auth.ts, user.ts, and session.ts"  
**Expected**: Plan detection triggers, generates multi-step plan, requests confirmation

### Test Case 2: Plan Execution
**Input**: Approve a generated plan  
**Expected**: Sequential execution of steps, progress reporting, final summary

### Test Case 3: Self-Correction
**Input**: Trigger refactoring_assistant with invalid parameters  
**Expected**: SELF_CORRECT_ATTEMPT signal, retry with multi_file_edit suggestion

### Test Case 4: Correction Limit
**Input**: Trigger 3+ consecutive self-corrections  
**Expected**: After 3 attempts, exhaustion message and stop retrying

### Test Case 5: Plan Rejection
**Input**: Reject a generated plan  
**Expected**: Falls back to standard agent loop

## üìä Metrics

- **Lines Added**: ~300 lines
- **Methods Added**: 5 new methods
- **Properties Added**: 2 new properties
- **Integration Points**: 3 major integrations
- **Build Status**: ‚úÖ Passing
- **TypeScript Errors**: 0

## üé® User Experience Improvements

### Visual Feedback
- üìã "Analyzing request complexity... Generating task plan..."
- ‚úÖ "Plan approved. Executing steps..."
- ‚úÖ "Plan execution complete! Successful steps: X, Failed steps: Y"
- üîÑ "Self-correction triggered. Retrying with alternative approach..."
- ‚ùå "Self-correction attempts exhausted. Please try a different approach."

### Intelligent Behavior
- Automatic detection of complex requests
- User confirmation before executing multi-step plans
- Graceful fallback to standard loop if planning fails
- Self-correction with LLM re-engagement
- Prevention of infinite correction loops

## üîÑ Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Complex Refactoring Request

```
User: "Refactor the authentication system to use JWT tokens across auth.ts, user.ts, and middleware.ts"

Agent:
üìã Analyzing request complexity... Generating task plan...

[Plan Preview]
Step 1: Analyze current authentication implementation
Step 2: Update auth.ts to use JWT
Step 3: Modify user.ts to handle JWT tokens
Step 4: Update middleware.ts for JWT validation

Approve plan? (y/n)

User: y

Agent:
‚úÖ Plan approved. Executing steps...
[Executes steps sequentially]
‚úÖ Plan execution complete!
   Successful steps: 4
   Failed steps: 0
```

### Example 2: Self-Correction Flow

```
User: "Refactor the UserService class to use dependency injection"

Agent: [Calls refactoring_assistant]
[Tool fails with complex error]

üîÑ Self-correction triggered. Retrying with alternative approach...

[LLM receives fallback request]
"Previous approach failed. Please use multi_file_edit tool to break down 
the refactoring into smaller, explicit file edits..."

[LLM generates new plan with multi_file_edit]
[Executes successfully]
```

## üöÄ Next Steps (Phase 4)

### Testing & Refinement
1. Write integration tests for plan detection
2. Test edge cases (empty plans, invalid dependencies)
3. Test self-correction limits
4. Performance optimization
5. Add telemetry for plan success rates

### Potential Enhancements
- Add plan caching for similar requests
- Implement parallel step execution (where dependencies allow)
- Add plan templates for common operations
- Enhance complexity scoring algorithm
- Add user preferences for auto-approval thresholds
